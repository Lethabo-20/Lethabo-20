## Hi there 👋
I’m Lethabo - an Honours student in Business and Financial Analytics at the University of the Free State. I am passionate about the intersection of AI, data science, and finance, and I aim to become a data analyst specialist focused on developing AI-driven solutions for real-world business and financial challenges. My interests lie in using advanced analytical techniques to uncover insights, solve complex problems, and drive innovation.

🌱My goal is to specialize in AI-powered data analysis, helping organizations make smarter, evidence-based decisions across the financial and business landscape. 

⚡Outside of academics and work, I’m a proud STEM enthusiast. I enjoy diving into topics across science, technology, and medicine, with a particular interest in health and psychology. I’m also a dog lover and value quality time with my family, both of which keep me balanced and inspired.
